# Assignment 1
The user audience for this website is catered to employers who would like to have a look at my portfolio. The purpose of this website is to create a portfolio about me, such that the employer have a better idea about me, and for me to showcase it to my employer. After navigating through my website, one should have a better idea about me.

## Design Process
For this assignment, this website has been designed to be simple, modern and aesthetically pleasing from the start. Personally as a user, I would like to navigate websites seamlessly with little clicks as much as possible. As employers tend to be busy with reviewing applicants and their portfolios, they would generally prefer so since it would reduce the time taken to review one's portfolio.

With that said, I had to think of what are the important pages and informations I should include on my site. By thinking through the perspective of what an employer would like to see, I have came up with Home, Educcation, Skills, Projects and Contact page. 

Previously a Reference page was also created, but I have since removed it since the employer or an average user would bother seeing it. Thus, I have moved it to a section and have also attached a Word document named "References". Doing so helps to make the navigation bar more simpler and clutter-free as well.

### Uniformity and Simplicity
As you navigate through the different pages, you would notice that there is strong uniformity in its design language and layout. Thinking from the perspective of an employer and a user, it would be much professional to keep it uniform and simple. Doing so helps to cut down on development time, as I could simply reuse the shell and modify accordingly to the page's requirements.

### Dark mode
All pages have been designed with dark mode in mind as well. As a user, if I were to view this at night or in a low-light environment, I would certainly prefer darker colours since it would not blind my eyes.

### Pictures
Multiple pictures have also been used to make the website look more modern and aesthetically pleasing. As a user, I would prefer a website with good aesthetics than those with terrible or no aesthetics, as it conveys a message to me that the developer bothered to put in the effort for even minor little details.

### Mockups and Diagrams
Attached here are my draft sketchup of how I envisioned each of my pages to look like when I started this assignment.
